A simple project that controls the position of a servo via an on-screen rotary dial for an iOS device.

Requirements
-------
To use this project you'll need the following:
* [TouchOSC](http://hexler.net/software/touchosc) on your iOS device and also the layout editor on your computer.
* [Processing](http://processing.org/), A programming environment for compiling and running the intermediary OSC --> Serial controller app.
* [Arduino](http://arduino.cc), A development environment for the Arduino microprocessor, you'll use this to install the serial --> servo sketch on your Arduino.
* A standard servo connected to pin 9 of your Arduino.
